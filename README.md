An online database of GM Intrusions.

##What and why?
My friend is really into a tabletop RPG called Numenera. In this game, sometimes the GM will offer XP to the player if they agree to let something go awry. Exempli gratia, the player succeeds at a jump check, but the GM thinks it'd be more interesting if the character were to fall into the bottomless pit, so they offer the player an XP if they agree that the character fell in after all, despite the successful roll.

Now, back to my friend. He had the idea to create an online database of GM Intrusions. That way if a GM had some players whose character were playing around with explosives, and s/he was having trouble coming up with something creative to go wrong, s/he could simply search for intrusions that had the "fire" or "explosions" tag to see what other people had come up with.

##It's [alive](http://www.gmintrusions.us)!
Though, still a work in progress. Heroku puts it to sleep if it hasn't been used in a while, so give it a second to wake up, then reload if you need to.

Check out the modals by clicking on New Intrusion or New Tag in the upper-right. If you add a new intrusion from the index page, it shows up immediately using AJAX magic! I have the initial data backed up, so feel free to play around.
